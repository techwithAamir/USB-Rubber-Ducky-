# USB-Rubber-Ducky-
This project is an Arduino-based USB Rubber Ducky clone that emulates a keyboard (HID device) to automatically execute pre-programmed keystroke payloads. It demonstrates how USB devices can be used to simulate real-world injection attacks and highlights the importance of strong authentication and endpoint security.
